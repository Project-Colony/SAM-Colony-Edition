#
# Sign a Colony release asset with the ed25519 release key, producing a detached
# "<asset>.sig" that the launcher verifies before applying a self-update.
#
# The signature is the raw 64-byte ed25519 signature over the asset bytes, as
# produced by `openssl pkeyutl -sign -rawin` - the same format src/signing.rs
# verifies against the embedded public key. openssl is the only dependency.
#
# A signature over raw bytes proves only "these bytes came from the org" - not
# WHICH artefact or WHICH version they are. So each asset also gets a signed
# metadata sidecar binding the bytes to a version and a filename:
#
#   <asset>.meta      version=<tag>\nasset=<basename>\nsha256=<hex>\n
#   <asset>.meta.sig  ed25519 signature over the .meta bytes
#
# The launcher verifies the sidecar and refuses anything that is not strictly
# newer than itself; app installs verify the same sidecar and refuse anything
# OLDER than what is already installed (equal is fine - an app pinned to a fixed
# tag must stay reinstallable). Either way, that is what stops a replay of an
# older org-signed build.
#
# Emitting sidecars for an app repo is safe to adopt at any time: Colony treats
# them as opportunistic, and only makes them mandatory for a given app once it
# has verified one (so a repo cannot silently stop publishing them).
#
# Usage:
#   COLONY_SIGNING_KEY=/path/to/colony-release.pem \
#   COLONY_RELEASE_VERSION=v1.2.3 ./scripts/sign-release.sh <asset> [<asset> ...]
#
# In CI, provide the private key via a secret (e.g. write it to a temp file from
# a GitHub Actions secret) and set COLONY_SIGNING_KEY to its path. Upload every
# generated "<asset>.sig", "<asset>.meta" and "<asset>.meta.sig" as release
# assets alongside their binary.
